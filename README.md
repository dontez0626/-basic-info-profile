# -basic-info-profile


# Project Description
The basic info profile is a command-line-input application run in Node(node index.js) that requests information from the user about members of an engineering team and generates an HTML file displaying that information. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of manager, engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a formatted team profile based on the information provided by the user.
